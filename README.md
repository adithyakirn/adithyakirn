# Hi, I’m @adithyakirn

- I’m interested in full stack web development, UI/UX design, and building modern, scalable web apps.
- I’m currently learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), TypeScript, and DevOps basics.
- I’m looking to collaborate on open-source full stack projects, startup MVPs, or anything that blends design and code.
- How to reach me: adithyakiran021@gmail.com
- Pronouns: He/Him
- Fun fact: I enjoy turning real-world problems into clean digital solutions—and love geeking out over front-end animations and back-end performance.
