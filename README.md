# 👋 Hi, I’m @adithyakirn

- 👀 I’m interested in full stack web development, UI/UX design, and building modern, scalable web apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), TypeScript, and DevOps basics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source full stack projects, startup MVPs, or anything that blends design and code.
- 📫 How to reach me: adithyakiran021@gmail.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy turning real-world problems into clean digital solutions—and love geeking out over front-end animations and back-end performance.
